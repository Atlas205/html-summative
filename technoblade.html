       <p>
               <li>axe of peace</li>
                  <p>Causes memory loss. Was seized by Tubbo during Techno's execution.
                       Ranboo returned it to Techno, who then allowed Tommy to use it because he was worthy. 
                       Tommy kept it during the second Festival after betraying Techno. During the chaos of the Doomsday War, 
                       Sapnap picked up the Axe of Peace from one of Tommy's deaths,
                        and intended to use it as leverage or bargaining on a later date, 
                        and didn't care if he dangled it above Tommy's or Techno's heads.
                         Ranboo has recently made Technoblade a new axe as a replacement for the Axe of Peace as a gratitude to Techno for letting him stay.
                          The original axe was in Sapnap's possession at the time. The axe was temporarily placed in Dream's collection,
                           but was quickly retrieved after a large force of Tommy's allies arrived to save him. Tommy possessed the Axe of Peace,
                            but due to his imprisonment and death in the prison, it was in the prison visitor locker room until Tommy's resurrection and release.</p>

               <li>orphan obliterator</li>
                  <p>Named by a Twitter poll, it is used to obliterate orphans. 
                      It was seized by Tubbo during Techno's execution. Ranboo later returned it to Technoblade alongside the Axe of Peace.</p>   

                  <li>rocket launcher (formely named subscribe to technoblade)</li>
                  <p>Used in the Manberg Massacre, Manberg vs Pogtopia War, 
                      and Doomsday War. As the name suggests, it is usually loaded with rockets instead of traditional arrows.

                    It was seized by Tubbo during Techno's execution, but later returned during a hostage exchange.</p>  

                  <li>trident</li>
                  <p>As the first trident on the server, it was used primarily for travel.

                    It was also seized by Tubbo during Techno's execution.
                     Tubbo kept the trident for movement quality of life, but used it very poorly.
                      During the Hostage Exchange, Tubbo lied to Techno that he gave the trident to Fundy and actually kept the trident in his ender chest, 
                      unwilling to give it up. This item was believed to be recovered by him during the Doomsday War, however, 
                      Techno is unsure if the current trident he has is his old one, as Tubbo never repaired Techno's
                       trident and the trident Techno recovered was almost at full durability.</p>  

                  <li>technodrill</li>
                  <p>Named by chat in his preparing for war stream.

                    It was seized by Tubbo during Techno's execution, but later returned during a hostage exchange.</p>  

                  <li>technoblades helmet</li>
                  <p>During Technoblade's execution, Tubbo had seized the armor and gave it to Ranboo. 
                      After the event, Ranboo visited Techno and Tommy and returned the set to Techno.</p>  

                  <li>technoblades chestplate</li>
                  <p>During Technoblade's execution, Tubbo had seized the armor and gave it to Ranboo.
                       After the event, Ranboo visited Techno and Tommy and returned the set to Techno.</p>  

                  <li>technoblades pants</li>
                  <p>During Technoblade's execution, Tubbo had seized the armor and gave it to Ranboo.
                       After the event, Ranboo visited Techno and Tommy and returned the set to Techno.</p>  

                  <li>technoblades boots</li>
                  <p>Too expensive to enchant with thorns despite Techno having 106 levels.

                    During Technoblade's execution, Tubbo had seized the armor and gave it to Ranboo.
                     After the event, Ranboo visited Techno and Tommy and returned the set to Techno.</p>  

                 <li>only piece of bedrock!</li>
                 <p>Obtained from Drista on December 14, 2020, after she dropped two pieces of bedrock in creative mode.
                      The other block of bedrock is currently held by Tommy. The name of this item was presumably supposed to be
                       "Only Piece Of Bedrock!" however, in a panic, Tubbo spelled it "peace". It is currently stored in Techno's ender chest.</p>

                    <li>technos notebook</li>
                  <p>Technoblade's notebook (formerly Eret's journal) where he plans with a list of items that he wishes to complete for the day.
                       It currently has 100 pages, but only the first three pages have been revealed. The notebook remains outdated, 
                       as Techno has not used it since Doomsday.</p>  

                  <li>toothpick</li>
                  <p>Obtained from a chest in the Final Control Room after Technoblade's Execution</p>        
                  
                  <li>techno shield</li>
                  <p>This shield was originally crafted by Philza with the purpose of giving it to Technoblade. 
                      The shield flies the banner of the Antarctic Empire, a nation that existed in SMP Earth.
                       Tommy renamed the shield to "Big Man Shield" after disliking the name "Technoshield".
                    It's current location is unknown, as Tommy died somewhere with the shield.</p>     

                  <li>pigstep</li>
                  <p>Given to Technoblade by Tommy as a Christmas gift. 
                      Tommy considers this the most dangerous weapon on the server since it can cause streamers and YouTubers to gain copyright strikes.
                       However, Techno has pointed out that it is ineffective against Dream because he doesn't stream.</p>   
                  
                  <li>diamantspitzhacke</li>
                  <p>Originally belonging to Tubbo, 
                      this pickaxe currently resides in a hidden barrel in Techno's house. 
                      The name is the German word for "diamond pickaxe".</p>

                        he slayed the Minotaur and saved his city. You know what they did to him, Tommy? They exiled him.

                        I wanna point out something, JSchlatt was lawfully elected. For all the stuff we say about him, at least he was elected, alright.
                         He might have been a war criminal, but at least people voted for him! You guys just did a hostile takeover, and then you were like,

                         I'm just repeating my speech from the video, it's fine. You know. I tried violence, I tried- I tried to reason with them,
                          I tried to stop government at all costs but it didn't work, I could not change the hearts of men- the greed- it was too hard to drive out.
                           So you know what? I'm just going into retirement Phil, I'm just going to chill. I'm gonna stop
                           - I'm gonna stop using violence to convince people, I'm just going to chill... In the Arctic North...
                            Maybe- Maybe I'll- Maybe I'll start a farm or something, y'know? I'll stop- I'll stop being a terrorist,
                             cause that just- it just- it just ain't convincing nobody Phil. It just- did- 
                             They just keep making new governments, Phil. I- I still believe... that governments are no good- 
                             it's just- they're just ruining everything- but you know... people are- people are free to make 
                             their mistakes at this point. I don't know." - Techno while talking to Phil</li>

                        the reason it's so hard for me to be non-violent... It's because I hear voices, 
                        Phil. I hear countless voices in my head. All the time." | Philza: "Voices?" | 
                        Techno: "Yeah. And the voices are crazy, Phil. Uh- Sometimes, they're angry, sometimes they're sad. 
                        Uh, sometimes they mock me. But the thing about the voices, Phil, the one thing they- 
                        the one- the one thing I hear from them the most... The voices demand blood,

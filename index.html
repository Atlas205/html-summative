    <h3>the history of D&D</h3>
    <p>D&D started in the 1974 and was first made by Tactical Studies Rules but since 1997 its been published by wizards of the coast</p>
    
    <h3>ways to play</h3>
     <p>theres many ways to play D&D with all the classes races and feats all able to change how you play for example you could be a paladin hitting foes from a distance and bringing back dead teamates
     or a wizard with low health but very high damage or even a rouge sneaking around and doing high damage in close or long range</p>
     
     <h4>feats</h4>
     <p>feats are one way to change how you play your character they can be mobile which increases how far you can move in combat or magic initiate which gives you two cantrips and one first level spell from the wizard, druid, bard, sorcerer, and warlock spell lists</p>

     <h4>spells</h4>
     <p>theres 9 levels of spells plus cantrips. cantrips are spells that can always be cast there is no limit and they tend to be weaker than most first level spells</p>
     <p>first level spells are the weakest rank of spells and as you go up in levels the spells become stronger and stronger even first level spells can be used as a ninth level all spells can be cast at higher levels which give them bonus damage if there a damage spell</p>
     <p>some examples of spells at each level are</p>
       <li>command</li>
       <li>burning hands</li>
       <li>false life</li>
